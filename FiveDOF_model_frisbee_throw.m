%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Define Movement duration  %%%%%%%%
% delta_t_ms is the amount of time between successive postures of
% the arm.  There are 44 postures during the throwing motion,
% from start to release.
% delta_t_ms = 3.8 produces a throw movement duration of 167.2 ms
% from start to release, indicated by a red arm in the plot of arm
% postures. movement_duration, originally set to 1, lengthen
% the duration by that factor. 

speed_up_factor = 1
delta_t_ms = 3.8/speed_up_factor 



%% Nominal Model - Joint Angles

% Initiaion 34 postures: from posture  1 to 34
% Throw-to-release 29 postures: from posture 35 to 64
% Deceleration of throw 15 postures: from posture 65 to 78

% The first 34 postures are initiation of the throw, as subject starts
% pointing frisbee at target (arm straight out to side) then draws the
% frisbee back to posture 35. The subject initiates the throw from posture
% 35 to release at posture 64.

%% Force Length Adjustment

% Determine the difference between the current angle and the reference angle
% for each posture. A necessary assuption is to know the optimal (or
% resting) fiber length (variable lo, pronounced "ell-naught") of each muscle.
% This is the length of the fibers for which sarcomeres are at optimal
% length, and at which it is assumed the parallel elastic element of muscle
% begins to stretch.
% This is usually not known for all muscles in the human arm. See the work of 
%Rick Liber and Jan Friden to get an idea of the current knowledge. In this model, 
%we assume that all muscles are at their lo in a posture towards the middle of the motion,
% shown in green. Posrure 14 is assumed to be the reference posture.
ref_angles = q(14, :);

% Find the difference in join angles for all postures with respect to the
% angles in the reference posture: variable change_q
for k=1:length(q)

% ********** Sign Convention to agree with classical f-v plots ********
% **** Negative velocities are eccentric contractions
% **** Positive velocities are concentric contractions
% Normalized fiber velocities >+/- 5 fiber lengths/second
% Based on the Zajac '89 paper, muscle fibers in concentric contractions
% faster than +5 fiber lengths/s are considered to produce no force.  
% Eccentric contractions are considered to
% produce microdamage in muscle, and if 
% faster than anbout -5 fiber lengths/sec can lead to tissue rupture.
